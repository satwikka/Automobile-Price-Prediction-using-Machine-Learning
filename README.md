## 📌 Project Overview

Accurate vehicle price estimation is essential for manufacturers, sellers, and buyers.  
In this project, multiple machine learning models are trained and compared to predict car prices 
based on key automobile features such as engine size, horsepower, mileage, and dimensions.

The best-performing model is deployed using a **Streamlit web application** that allows users 
to input vehicle details and get real-time price predictions.
